**MyTalentList** is a World of Warcraft addon designed to export your character's current build (Talents, Spellbook, and Tier Sets) into a clean, spreadsheet-ready **CSV format**.

It is perfect for theorycrafters or players who want to analyze their build in **Excel** or **Google Sheets**.

## 🌟 Key Features

* **Complete Export:** Generates a detailed list containing your **Active Talents**, **Spellbook Abilities** (Passives, Mastery, Racials), and **Tier Set Bonuses**.
* **Tier Set Detection:** Automatically scans your equipped gear to find active Tier Set bonuses (2-piece and 4-piece) and captures their full descriptions directly from the tooltip.
* **Smart Spec Filtering:** Automatically detects your current Specialization (e.g., Protection) and hides spells from other specs (e.g., Holy/Retribution) to keep the data clean.
* **Excel-Ready CSV:** The output is formatted strictly for CSV. Just copy, save as `.csv`, and open in Excel.

## 📖 How to Use

1.  Log in to your character.
